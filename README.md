# CS 1332 - Data Structures and Algorithms (Spring 2021)
I took CS 1332 @ Gatech in the Spring of 2021.

Lectured by Dr. Mark Moss.

## About
After thinking about it a little more, I'm not sure it's a great idea to link the syllabus directly to any of my classes anyway.

I'll link the [official course lising page](https://oscar.gatech.edu/bprod/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201302&subj_code_in=CS&crse_numb_in=1332), but I won't include any direct syllabuses(?...syllabus? syllabi?).

Anyway, this class was also taught in Java.
### Course Curriculum
- Develop skills in Java programming
- Work with common data structures used in software development by coding their low-level implementation
  * Arrays, Arraylists
  * LinkedLists (Singular, Doubly, Circular)
  * Stacks, Queues, Deques, Priority Queues
  * Various Trees: Binary, Binary Search, AVL, Splay, Heaps, 2-4 Trees, etc...
  * Hash Maps/Tables; External Chaining and Various Probing Techniques
  * Graphs and their Asscoiated Algorithms
- Become familiar with common algorithms on these data structures
  * Sorting Algorithms: Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Cocktail Shaker, Merge, Quick, Radix etc...
  * Pattern Matching Algorithms: Brute force, Boyer-Moore, KMP, Rabin-Karp
  * Graph Algorithms: Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path and multiple MSTs
  * Memoization & Dynamic Programming Approaches
- Work with Big-O notation, allowing good choices about the appropriate data structure and algorithm to use for a particular programming problem
- Improve one's ability to test and debug programs
### Assignments
1. Arraylists - First exposure to regularly writting exception handling, created arraylists without arraylists, and packaging my assignments
2. Linkedlists - Recreated circular singularly linked list, brief description of garbage collection in Java
3. BST (Binary Search Trees) - Recursively created a BST implemented with a Comparable interface
4. Heaps - MaxHeap
5. AVL Trees (Adelson-Velsky and Landis Trees) - Using the previous BST as a reference, created a recursively implemented AVL Tree
6. Hashmaps - W/o Hashmap import
7. Sorting - Insertion Sort, Cocktail Sort, Merge Sort, LSD (Least Significant Digit) radix sort, quick sort, and comparator
8. Pattern Matching - Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), Boyer-moore, Rabin Karp pattern searching algorithms
9. Graphs - Vertex Distance (minimum cumulative path cost), DFS (Depth First Search), Dijkstra's algorithm for graph path search algorithms
### Debrief
I don't remember much about this class in terms of how I felt, but I do remember how aggresively annoying the Checkstyle was. 

That said, it earns points back because the professor and TAs had a [data structure visualization website](https://csvistool.com/about). It helped (so much) in understanding, building, and working with each data structure covered. 

(It was also hilarious to see that each assignment had a Vulgar/Obscene language policy on all code written and turned-in. Someone had to have turned something in truly vulgar to upset the professors and TAs...)

I also remember that this was my first time hearing about most of these algorithms, and the hardest part of implementing the algorithms was understanding them first. 

# Disclaimer
As most of the course content belongs to either the College or the Professors, I am transcribing my work and assignments to record the course.

As such, many assignments and files **may not include detailed descriptions or solutions**. This is done to avoid violations, avoid doxxing myself and others, and any number of other reasons. If for any reason the full repo must be accessed, all assignments, descriptions, solutions, and class files are stored in a private version of the repo (so contact me. If you're a current student, don't bother since I won't give you access and it wouldn't help you anyway xp).

If possible, portions of the class will be linked to a separate readme explaining more about the linked assignment/solution/description/other.

If there exist any honorcode violations or any problems/solutions are *too* in-depth, please contact me. The intention of each public class repo is to record my experience and assignments of each class taken.
